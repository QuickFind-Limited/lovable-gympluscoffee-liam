# QA Testing Protocol for Source Application

## Testing Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive testing protocol for validating the Source application functionality during development changes.

## Baseline Testing âœ… (Completed)
- **Application Access**: Successfully navigated to http://localhost:8080
- **Authentication Page**: Properly rendered with Sign In/Sign Up tabs
- **Console Status**: Clean - only expected development messages
- **Initial Screenshot**: Captured baseline state

## Test Phases

### Phase 1: Authentication Flow Testing
**Status**: Next Phase

- [ ] Test user login
- [ ] Test logout functionality
- [ ] Verify session management
- [ ] Test invalid credentials handling

### Phase 2: Dashboard & Navigation Testing
**Status**: Pending
- [ ] Navigate to dashboard after auth
- [ ] Test sidebar navigation
- [ ] Test menu functionality
- [ ] Verify breadcrumbs
- [ ] Test responsive behavior

### Phase 3: Product Catalog Testing
**Status**: Pending
- [ ] Navigate to products catalog
- [ ] Test product search functionality
- [ ] Test product filters
- [ ] Test pagination
- [ ] Verify product cards rendering
- [ ] Test product details view

### Phase 4: Order Management Testing
**Status**: Pending
- [ ] Navigate to orders page
- [ ] Test order creation process
- [ ] Test MOQ validation
- [ ] Test purchase order generation
- [ ] Verify order status management

### Phase 5: Supplier Management Testing
**Status**: Pending
- [ ] Navigate to suppliers page
- [ ] Test supplier listing
- [ ] Test supplier product filtering
- [ ] Verify supplier details

### Phase 6: Console Error Monitoring
**Status**: Ongoing
- [ ] Monitor for JavaScript errors
- [ ] Check for React warnings
- [ ] Verify API call responses
- [ ] Document any regressions

## Test Checkpoints
- **Before file changes**: Establish baseline
- **After each major change**: Incremental validation
- **After all changes**: Final comprehensive test

## Critical Failure Points
If any of these fail, stop other agents immediately:
1. Application fails to load
2. Authentication completely broken
3. Navigation completely broken
4. Core functionality unusable

## Success Criteria
- All core user flows work without errors
- No new console errors introduced
- No visual regressions
- Performance remains acceptable
