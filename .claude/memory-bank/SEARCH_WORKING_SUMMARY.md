# ðŸŽ‰ SEARCH IS WORKING! - Odoo Integration Success

## Summary of Fix
After extensive debugging, we discovered the critical issue: the `image_1920` field was causing massive 266KB responses that were failing to parse. By removing this field, responses dropped to 1.4KB and search started working perfectly!

## Working Solution
- **Endpoint**: `odoo-search-working` 
- **Key Fix**: Removed `image_1920` from fields list
- **Result**: Successfully finds Acralube 5Ltr and other products

## Test Results
```bash
Searching for "acra"...
âœ… SUCCESS! Found 2 products:
  - ID: 45, Name: "Acralube 5Ltr"
    Display: "[ANF-00004] Acralube 5Ltr"
    Price: 7.4
  - ID: 223, Name: "Iso940 Betacraft Fluoroparka"  
    Display: "[ANF-00182] Iso940 Betacraft Fluoroparka"
    Price: 315
```

## Technical Details
- Simple XML parser implementation (no external dependencies)
- Direct XML-RPC calls to Odoo
- Hardcoded credentials (env vars not working in edge functions)
- Simple domain search: `[['name', 'ilike', query]]`

## Frontend Update
Updated `useVectorSearch.ts` to use the working endpoint:
```typescript
const response = await fetch(`${supabaseUrl}/functions/v1/odoo-search-working`, {
```

## Next Steps
1. Test in the app UI
2. Investigate why main function still fails
3. Update other integration points
4. Re-enable authentication
