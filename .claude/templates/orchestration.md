%%
%% IMPORTANT: THOSE INSTRUCTIONS ARE FOR THE AI, DO NOT OUTPUT THEM IN FINAL GENERATION
%%
%% Rules:
%% - Simplest possible `flowchart TD`
%% - Use descriptive labels for human actions/decisions (e.g. ["User validates ideas"])
%% - Write in English
%%
%% Agents
%% - Agents are named by user, DO NOT GUESS Them
%% - Mention participants (e.g. "AI", "User", "agent_slug")
%% - Agent actions are snake_case (e.g. `load_memory_bank`)
%% - Actions can have $ARGUMENTS (e.g. `load_memory_bank($ARGUMENTS)`)
%% - Agents calling with `>agent_name]`
%% - Agents calling with $ARGUMENTS `>"agent_name($ARGUMENTS)"]`
%%
%% Connections:
%% - Use `-->` for standard flow
%% - Use `A` -> `Z` for naming connections
%% - Use `{Decision?}` for conditional branches
%% - Ressources loading are printed with `[(data)]`, no agents
%% - When ressources is bound to an agent, do not display it (already ok being in arguments)
