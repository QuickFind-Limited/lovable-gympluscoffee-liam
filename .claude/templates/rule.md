# How to fill frontmatter header:

description: One line. Comprehensive description that provides full context and clearly indicates when this rule should be applied. Include key scenarios, impacted areas, and why following this rule is important. While being thorough, remain focused and relevant. The description should be detailed enough that the agent can confidently determine whether to apply the rule in any given situation.

globs: Appropriate extension language based on language AND current structure directory (look existing codebase)

alwaysApply: false, except for global rules like clean code etc.

# Rules content:

## Groups

- Not needed for short rules content
- Identify rule groups
- Wait for user validation
- No MD titles, use "Group's name :"
- Use small generic example peer group

## Bullet point rules

- When mentioned existing specific code, please mention full file path prefixed by "@" (no backticks, no need to write folder mentions)
- Backticks for code ref
- Bullet points only
- Remove non-essential, no fluff
- 1 ultra short (3â€“7 words) rule per bullet point
