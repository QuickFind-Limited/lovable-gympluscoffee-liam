<!--
IMPORTANT: THOSE ARE RULES FOR AI, DO NOT USE THOSE INTO FILLED TEMPLATE.

- FOCUS: Rationales, trade-offs, lessons learned, anti-patterns
- EXCLUDE: Implementation details, version-specific info, current architecture
- EXAMPLES: Chose React over Vue because..., Avoided Redux due to..., Learned that X pattern causes Y issue
- NEVER INCLUDE: Current implementation details, deployment processes
-->

## Critical Choices & Rationales

- [Choice A vs B]: Chose A because [performance/security/maintainability reason]
- [Technical approach]: Avoided X pattern due to [past issues/complexity]
- [Process decision]: Adopted Y approach to prevent [specific problem]

## Lessons Learned

- **Bug Prevention**: Never use [pattern] because it caused [issue] in production
- **Performance**: [Specific optimization] improved [metric] by [amount]
- **Security**: Implemented [measure] after [incident/vulnerability]
- **UX**: Changed [approach] based on user feedback about [issue]

## Trade-offs Made

- [Feature/Performance]: Sacrificed [X] for [Y] because [business reason]
- [Complexity/Speed]: Chose simple solution over [complex one] for [maintainability]
- [Cost/Quality]: Used [cheaper option] accepting [limitation] due to [constraint]

## Anti-patterns to Avoid

- [Pattern]: Causes [specific problem] - use [alternative] instead
- [Approach]: Led to [issue] in [context] - prefer [solution]
- [Technology/Library]: Abandoned due to [reason] - replaced with [alternative]

## Constraints & Context

- [Business constraint]: Had to [decision] because [external factor]
- [Technical debt]: Temporary solution for [reason] - needs [future action]
- [Timeline pressure]: Quick fix chosen over [ideal solution] - revisit in [timeframe]
