State Management:

- `useState` must be in hooks
- Export functional methods, not setters
- `useState` only for UI state, not data/business logic

```typescript
export function useDialog() {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);
  
  const open = () => setIsOpen(true);
  const close = () => setIsOpen(false);
  
  return { isOpen, open, close };
}
```
