# IMPORTANT: Vite Dev Server Restart Required

## Issue Identified
The frontend application was showing products from the old Supabase project because the Vite development server was started BEFORE the environment variables were updated.

## Solution
The Vite dev server has been restarted to load the new environment variables:
- **New Supabase URL**: https://fttkapvhobelvodnqxgu.supabase.co
- **New Project**: "Odoo Gym Plus Coffee"

## What Changed
1. Updated `.env` file with new Supabase credentials
2. Updated `src/config/supabase.config.ts` with new keys
3. Restarted Vite dev server to load the new configuration

## Verification
The app should now:
- Connect to the new Supabase project
- Show the 522 products from Odoo (not the old 445 products)
- Use the Odoo data source with products like "15Ft Spare Hose For Ergo Pro Single Motor Dryer"

## Note
If you still see old data:
1. Clear your browser cache
2. Open the app in an incognito/private window
3. Check the Network tab in browser DevTools to verify it's calling the new Supabase URL
