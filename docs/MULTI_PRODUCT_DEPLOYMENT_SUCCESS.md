# Multi-Product Query Parser Deployment Success

## Issue Resolved
The error "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')" at SearchBar.tsx:46 has been successfully resolved.

## Root Cause
The parse-query edge function was deployed with an outdated single-product schema that returned:
```json
{
  "product_description": "blue shirts",
  "quantity": 5
}
```

Instead of the expected multi-product format:
```json
{
  "products": [
    {
      "product_description": "blue shirts", 
      "quantity": 5
    }
  ]
}
```

## Solution
Successfully deployed parse-query edge function version 6 with multi-product support using Supabase MCP.

## Verification Results

### Test 1: Basic Multi-Product Query
Query: "I need 5 blue shirts and 3 red pants"
Result: ✅ Correctly parsed 2 products with quantities 5 and 3

### Test 2: Complex Query with Special Words
Query: "I want a dozen white t-shirts, 2 pairs of shoes, and 5 hats"
Result: ✅ Correctly parsed:
- 12 white t-shirts (converted "a dozen")
- 4 shoes (converted "2 pairs")
- 5 hats

## Feature Status
The multi-product query parser is now fully operational with:
- ✅ Natural language parsing for multiple products
- ✅ Quantity word conversion (dozen, pair, etc.)
- ✅ Parallel vector search for all products
- ✅ Proper error handling in frontend
- ✅ Edge function returning correct format

## Next Steps
The feature is ready for end-to-end testing in the UI. Users can now:
1. Enter queries like "I need 5 blue shirts and 3 red pants"
2. See parsing progress for multiple products
3. View all matched products in the purchase order
4. Each product will have the correct requested quantity
