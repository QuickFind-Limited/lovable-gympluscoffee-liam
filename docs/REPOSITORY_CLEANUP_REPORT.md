## Benefits
1. **Improved Navigation** - Clear directory structure makes finding files easier
2. **Better Organization** - Related files are grouped together
3. **Cleaner Root** - Root directory only contains essential files
4. **Test Isolation** - All tests in dedicated directory
5. **Tool Separation** - External tools isolated from main code

## Application Status
✅ Application tested and working after reorganization
✅ All imports and paths updated
✅ Development server runs successfully

## Recommendations
1. Update any CI/CD scripts to use new test locations
2. Update documentation to reflect new structure
3. Consider adding a CONTRIBUTING.md with directory structure guide
4. Set up pre-commit hooks to maintain organization
