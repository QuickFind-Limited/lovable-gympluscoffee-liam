## üöÄ Ready for Transaction Generation

The product mapping is now ready to be used by the bulk import process to generate realistic transaction data that:

1. **Follows Revenue Distribution:** Top 20% of products generate 60-75% of revenue
2. **Respects Seasonal Patterns:** Summer items sell more Jun-Aug, winter items Nov-Feb
3. **Applies Size Logic:** M and L sizes are most popular (proper distribution)
4. **Uses Color Preferences:** Black and white products have highest sales probability
5. **Maintains Product Relationships:** Variants of same product template coordinated

## üéØ Next Steps

The mapping file `/workspaces/source-lovable-gympluscoffee/odoo-ingestion/product_mapping.json` is ready for use in:

1. **Transaction Generation Scripts** - Use `product_lookup` for quick product access
2. **Seasonal Sales Modeling** - Apply `seasonal_boost` factors by month
3. **Revenue Tier Implementation** - Use `revenue_tiers` for weighted product selection
4. **Size/Color Distribution** - Use `product_attributes` for variant sales modeling

**File Location:** `/workspaces/source-lovable-gympluscoffee/odoo-ingestion/product_mapping.json`
