## üéØ VALIDATION RESULTS

- D2C E-commerce: Target 60% ‚Üí **Unable to measure**
- Retail Stores: Target 20% ‚Üí **Unable to measure**  
- B2B Wholesale: Target 20% ‚Üí **Unable to measure**

**Recommendation:** Implement proper sales team configuration and order channel tagging.

### 2. GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION ANALYSIS

**‚ùå FAILED - Geographic Data Insufficient**

**Current State:**
- 236 total customers processed
- Limited geographic diversity (only 3 countries represented)
- Most customers lack proper country assignment

**Target vs Actual:**
| Country | Target | Actual | Variance | Status |
|---------|--------|---------|----------|--------|
| UK | 50% | 0.0% | -50.0% | ‚ùå FAIL |
| US | 20% | 0.4% | -19.6% | ‚ùå FAIL |
| Australia | 20% | 0.0% | -20.0% | ‚ùå FAIL |
| Ireland | 10% | 0.0% | -10.0% | ‚ùå FAIL |

**Recommendation:** Enhance customer data with proper country assignments and geographic targeting.

### 3. BUSINESS METRICS ANALYSIS

#### Average Order Value (AOV)
**‚úÖ PARTIAL PASS - AOV Above Minimum Thresholds**

**Current State:**
- Overall AOV: ‚Ç¨334 (excellent performance)
- Based on 2,578 confirmed orders
- Single channel classification limits detailed analysis

**Target vs Actual:**
- Online AOV: Target ‚Ç¨90-120 ‚Üí **‚Ç¨334 (exceeds target)**
- Retail AOV: Target ‚Ç¨70-100 ‚Üí **Unable to measure separately**
- B2B AOV: Target ‚Ç¨500-2500+ ‚Üí **Unable to measure separately**

#### Repeat Buyer Rate
**‚ùå FAILED - Rate Significantly Above Target Range**

**Current State:**
- Repeat Buyer Rate: **95.0%** (192 of 202 customers)
- Target Range: 28-32%
- **Variance: +63%** above target

**Analysis:** This extremely high repeat rate suggests data quality issues or concentrated customer base rather than healthy business metrics.

#### Return Rates & BOPIS Orders
**‚ö†Ô∏è INCOMPLETE - Data Not Available**
- Return rate analysis requires refund/return transaction data
- BOPIS validation requires delivery method categorization

### 4. DATA QUALITY METRICS

#### SKU Sales Coverage
**‚ùå FAILED - 15% of SKUs Have No Sales**

**Current State:**
- Products with sales: 442 of 522 total products
- Coverage: **84.7%** (Target: 100%)
- 80 products have no associated sales

**Recommendation:** Review inactive SKUs for catalog cleanup or enhanced marketing.

#### Inventory Management
**‚úÖ PASSED - No Negative Stock**

**Current State:**
- Negative stock items: **0** (Target: 0)
- Stock management: Healthy
- Inventory tracking: 30 products with detailed tracking

#### Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule)
**‚ùå FAILED - Revenue Distribution Suboptimal**

**Current State:**
- Top 20% products generate: **57.2%** of revenue
- Target: 60-75%
- **Variance: -2.8%** below minimum

**Analysis:** Revenue is more evenly distributed than typical retail patterns, suggesting potential pricing or merchandising optimization opportunities.
