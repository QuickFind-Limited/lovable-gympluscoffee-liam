# Manual Test: Supplier Name in Search Results

## Test Objective
Verify that when searching for products, the supplier/vendor name is correctly displayed instead of "Odoo Product".

## Test Steps

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open the application** in your browser (usually http://localhost:5173 or http://localhost:8080)

3. **Navigate to the Dashboard**

4. **In the search bar, type:** "I need acralube"

5. **Press Enter or click the search button**

6. **Expected Results:**
   - Search results should show products
   - The supplier name should show the actual supplier (e.g., "Acralube", "Impala", etc.)
   - The supplier name should NOT show "Odoo Product"

## What Was Fixed

### Problem
When searching for products from the dashboard search bar, all products were showing "Odoo Product" as the supplier name, regardless of their actual supplier.

### Root Cause
The supplier/vendor field was hardcoded to "Odoo Product" in multiple places:
- `/src/hooks/useVectorSearch.ts` (lines 420, 434)
- `/src/utils/searchClient.ts` (line 83)
- `/src/hooks/useProductSearch.ts` (line 121)
- `/src/hooks/useInfiniteOdooProducts.ts` (line 119)

### Solution
1. Created a new edge function `product-search-enhanced` that:
   - Fetches product data from Odoo
   - Retrieves seller_ids for each product
   - Queries the `product.supplierinfo` model to get actual supplier names
   - Returns products with proper supplier information

2. Updated all frontend code to use the actual supplier data:
   ```typescript
   vendor: product.vendor || product.supplier_name || product.supplier || 'Unknown Supplier'
   ```

## Verification

To verify the fix is working:

1. Check the network tab in browser DevTools
2. Look for the request to `product-search-enhanced`
3. Verify the response includes `supplier_name` or `vendor` fields with actual supplier names
4. Verify the UI displays these supplier names correctly

## Edge Cases

- If a product has no supplier information, it should show "Unknown Supplier"
- If a product has multiple suppliers, it should show the first one
- The supplier name should be used when creating purchase orders from search results
