# Odoo MCP Connection Issue - SOLVED ✅

## Problem Summary
The Odoo MCP server was failing to connect when used with Claude Desktop or other MCP clients. The server would start but wouldn't establish a connection to the Odoo instance.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Python Version Mismatch**: The `pyproject.toml` required Python >=3.13, but the environment had Python 3.12.1
2. **Environment Variables Not Loaded**: The server wasn't loading the `.env` file automatically
3. **Missing Package Installation**: The server wasn't installed as a Python package

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Python Version Requirement
Changed `pyproject.toml`:
```toml
# Before
requires-python = ">=3.13"

# After
requires-python = ">=3.12"
```

### 2. Added Environment Variable Loading
Modified `src/odoo_mcp/server.py` to load `.env` file:
```python
# Added in lifespan function
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
```

### 3. Installed the Package
```bash
python -m pip install -e .
```

## How to Use the Fixed Server

### 1. Ensure Environment Variables are Set
Create a `.env` file with:
```env
ODOO_URL=https://your-instance.odoo.com
ODOO_DATABASE=your-database
ODOO_USERNAME=your-username
ODOO_PASSWORD=your-password
```

### 2. Run the Server
The server now works in stdio mode (required for MCP):
```bash
python -m odoo_mcp
# or
odoo-mcp-server
```

### 3. Configure in Claude Desktop
Add to your Claude Desktop configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "odoo": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "odoo_mcp"],
      "cwd": "/workspaces/odoo_mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## Server Features

✅ **Automatic Connection**: Loads default Odoo connection from environment variables
✅ **STDIO Mode**: Runs in stdio transport mode for MCP compatibility
✅ **Full CRUD Operations**: All Odoo operations available through MCP tools
✅ **Type Safety**: Fully typed Python 3.12+ implementation
✅ **FastMCP Framework**: Uses FastMCP 2.10.6 for optimal performance

## Available MCP Tools

- `odoo_create` - Create new records
- `odoo_read` - Read existing records
- `odoo_update` - Update records
- `odoo_delete` - Delete records
- `odoo_search` - Search for record IDs
- `odoo_search_read` - Search and read in one operation
- `odoo_search_count` - Count matching records
- `odoo_fields_get` - Get model field definitions
- `odoo_execute` - Execute any model method

## Testing the Connection

You can test the connection directly:
```python
# The server will automatically connect using environment variables
# Use instance_id="default" in all MCP tool calls
```

## Status
✅ **FIXED** - The Odoo MCP server is now fully functional and ready to use with Claude Desktop or any MCP client.
