# Odoo MCP Server Test Results

## Test Summary

Date: 2025-07-29
Test Environment: Odoo instance at https://source2.odoo.com

## Test Results

### ‚úÖ Connection Test
- Successfully connected to Odoo instance
- Instance ID: `default`
- Database: source2

### ‚úÖ CRUD Operations

#### Create
- Created partner with ID 56
- Fields: name, email, phone, street, city, is_company, website
- Result: Successfully created

#### Read
- Read single record (ID 56)
- All fields retrieved successfully
- Note: When reading without field specification, all fields are returned

#### Update
- Updated partner ID 56
- Changed: phone, street, comment
- Result: Successfully updated

#### Delete
- Deleted partner ID 56
- Verification: Record no longer exists
- Result: Successfully deleted

### ‚úÖ Search Operations

#### odoo_search
- Basic search: `[]` - Returns all partner IDs
- Filtered search: `[["email", "=", "test.mcp@example.com"]]` - Returns matching IDs
- Result: Working correctly

#### odoo_search_count
- Count all partners: 12 records
- Count companies: `[["is_company", "=", true]]` - 8 records
- Result: Working correctly

#### odoo_search_read
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue: Error when retrieving all fields for multiple records
- Error: "Expected singleton" - appears to be an Odoo-side issue with computed fields
- Workaround: Use odoo_search + odoo_read or specify limited fields

### ‚úÖ Field Definitions

#### odoo_fields_get
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue: Response exceeds 25,000 token limit
- Reason: res.partner has many fields with detailed metadata
- Workaround: Would need to implement field filtering in the tool

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Advanced Operations

#### odoo_execute
- Tested methods: `name_get`, `check_access_rights`
- Issues:
  - Some methods don't exist or aren't exposed via RPC
  - XML-RPC marshalling errors for certain return types
- Note: Requires knowledge of available Odoo methods

### üîç Discovered Limitations

1. **Parameter Schema Issues**
   - The `limit` parameter appears to have schema validation issues
   - Workaround: Use without limit or investigate correct schema

2. **Large Response Handling**
   - Field definitions can exceed token limits
   - Search_read with all fields can cause errors
   - Solution needed: Implement response pagination or field filtering

3. **Method Availability**
   - Not all Odoo methods are available via RPC
   - Some methods have been removed in newer versions

## Recommendations

1. **For Production Use:**
   - Always specify fields when using read operations
   - Use search + read separately for complex queries
   - Be aware of token limits for large responses

2. **Tool Improvements Needed:**
   - Add field filtering to odoo_fields_get
   - Better error handling for schema validation
   - Documentation of available methods for odoo_execute

3. **Best Practices:**
   - Use specific field lists to reduce response size
   - Test with small datasets first
   - Handle errors gracefully in client applications

## Overall Assessment

The Odoo MCP Server is **functional and ready for use** with the following caveats:
- Basic CRUD operations work perfectly
- Search functionality is reliable
- Some advanced features need refinement
- Token limits require consideration for large datasets

The integration provides a solid foundation for AI-powered Odoo interactions.
